I consider this project to be finished, because it fulfills my requirements.
Still, there is a huge potential for extension of this tool, so grab the code and make improvements
if you like. I appreciate all pushed improvements..


ADDITION:
	In the folder kapichrome you find the chrome plugin which implements the most important features
	(from my point of view) of the KapiSkript addon... I didn't want to create a special
	repository for it, so I put it here...

	With the chrome extension you can set production by time and select "everything" of an item type
	at the warehouse for selling (which saves a lot of calculating and mouse clicks)
