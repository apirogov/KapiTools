KapiManager:	Enables to do everyday jobs in Kapiland more easily and offering a nice CLI for Kapiland.
KapiNotify:		Get informed when your production is ready!

Usage of KapiTools:

	run KapiManager.rb, enter your login data and issue commands...
		use command 'help' to get a list of valid commands
		German users: check out TUTORIAL_GER.TXT!

	run KapiNotify.rb - tired of reloading page and checking your production? KapiNotify will run in the
		background and show messages if something interesting happens!
		(NOTE: you must have already entered your login data into KapiManager for KapiNotify to work properly!)


Requirement:
	ruby gem 'mechanize'


I regard this project as finished, because it fulfills my requirements. Still, there is a huge
potential for extension of this tool, so grab the code and make improvements if you like.

I appreciate all pushed improvements..


ADDITION:
	In the folder kapichrome you find the chrome plugin which implements the most important features
	(from my point of view) of the KapiSkript addon... I didn't want to create a special
	repository for it, so I put it here...

	With the chrome extension you can set production by time and select "everything" of an item type
	at the warehouse for selling (which saves a lot of calculating and mouse clicks)
